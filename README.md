## React Clean Calendar [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-clean-calendar.png)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-clean-calendar)

`react-clean-calendar` is a react calendar component that handles the date and basic display logic needed to render a 
calendar. It calculates how many weeks to render per month, what day the month begins on, and which date belongs on 
each calendar day.

The rest is up to you! `react-clean-calendar` exposes a `renderDay` prop to you, letting you decide how to render the 
calendar days.

`react-clean-calendar` is meant to be a base for you to build your own custom calendars on top of. It's very much a 
'batteries-not-included' library, although it does provide some basic defaults to get you started.
