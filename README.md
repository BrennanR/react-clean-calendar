# Simple Calendar

simple-calendar is a react calendar component that handles all the logic needed to render a calendar. It calculates how
many weeks to render per month as well as what day the month begins on and which date belongs on each calendar day.

The rest is up to you! simple-calendar exposes a dateRenderer prop to you and you decide how to render the calendar.

simple-calendar is meant to be a base for you to built your own custom calendars on top of. It's very much a 
batteries-not-included library, although it does provide some simple defaults.
