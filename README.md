# Simple Calendar

`simple-calendar` is a react calendar component that handles the date and basic display logic needed to render a calendar. It calculates how many weeks to render per month, what day the month begins on, and which date belongs on each calendar day.

The rest is up to you! `simple-calendar` exposes a `renderDay` prop to you, letting you decide how to render the calendar days.

`simple-calendar` is meant to be a base for you to build your own custom calendars on top of. It's very much a 
'batteries-not-included' library, although it aims provide some simple defaults.
